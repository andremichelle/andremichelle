### Hi! It's me, AndrÃ© Michelle

I'm actively seeking new career opportunities where I can leverage my 16 years of hands-on experience as the originator and lead developer at [audiotool.com](https://audiotool.com/product), a venture where I played a pivotal role in shaping the overall concept and driving its development. In addition to this, I bring over 25 years of experience as a programmer and digital artist to the table.

Besides my tech know-how on web technologies and essential digital signal processing, I've navigated the complexities of large application infrastructures and understand how to keep things scalable. While I can still code cleanly and rigorously test in various web languages, what truly sets me apart is my ability to transform ideas into code and user-friendly experiences (UX). I also consider myself a supportive team leader, giving everybody the mindfulness to deliver better output.

I'm eager to bring my wealth of experience and passion for innovation to a new professional challenge.
